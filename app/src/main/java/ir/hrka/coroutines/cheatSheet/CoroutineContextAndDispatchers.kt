    /**
     * * A coroutine context is indeed a collection of various elements that
     * control the behavior of coroutines (commonly dispatcher and job).
     * * Dispatcher determines the thread or thread pool where the coroutine will be executed.
     * * Job represents the lifecycle of the coroutine (cancel it, join it, start it, get status).
     * * Types of dispatchers:
     *    * Dispatchers.Main (Run coroutine on main thread)
     *    * Dispatchers.IO (Run coroutine on pool of IO thread)
     *    * Dispatchers.Default (Run coroutine on pool of IO thread that optimized for CPU intensive task)
     *    * Dispatchers.Unconfined (start running coroutine on the caller thread but only until the first suspension point)
     *    * newSingleThreadContext creates a thread for the coroutine to run.
     * * We can use explicitly job (Create a common job instance) or implicitly job (returned from coroutine builder).
     * * When launch is used without parameters, it inherits the context from the CoroutineScope it is being launched from.
     * * The unconfined dispatcher is appropriate for coroutines which neither consume CPU time nor
     * update any shared data (like UI) confined to a specific thread.
     * * We can use the + operator for multiple elements for a coroutine context.
     * * Default dispatchers depending on the context in which the coroutine is launched:
     *    * The default dispatcher for runBlocking is confined to the calling thread.
     *    * In GlobalScope uses Dispatchers.Default.
     *    * CoroutineScope without Dispatcher: inherits the dispatcher from the context in which the scope was created.
     *    If no dispatcher is specified in the parent context, it falls back to Dispatchers.Default.
